# Project Title ‚Äì Hospitality Revenue Dashboard

## üìå Overview

The Hospitality Revenue Analysis Dashboard is an interactive business intelligence tool designed to provide hotel and hospitality operators with a comprehensive overview of operational and financial performance. It offers detailed insights into revenue generation, room performance, booking patterns, and guest behavior‚Äîempowering data-driven decision-making for property managers and revenue analysts.

## üîç Problem Statement

In the hospitality industry, managing revenue performance across multiple properties, cities, and booking platforms is a complex challenge. Hotel operators often struggle with fragmented data sources, inconsistent performance metrics, and limited visibility into key indicators such as revenue, occupancy, RevPAR, and customer behavior.

This lack of centralized and actionable insights leads to:

Missed opportunities for optimizing pricing strategies and booking channels

Difficulty identifying underperforming properties or time periods

Inefficient forecasting and decision-making due to delayed or manual reporting

## üìä Tools & Technologies Used

- SQL
- Power BI / Tableau
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Excel
- Git & GitHub

---

## üìÅ Dataset

Used Atliq dataset from Atliq's site containing:
- Time Dimension: Weekly (W19‚ÄìW31), aggregated for trend and comparative analysis

- Geographic Dimension: City-level, with property-level detail

- Platform Dimension: Bookings grouped by source/channel

- Category Dimension: Room types (Business vs Luxury) details.

---

## üß† Approach

1. Data Collection & Integration
- Gathered raw data
- Consolidate data into a structured format with dimensions like: Time (weekly/monthly), Geography (city, property), Room category, Platform source

2. Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Handle missing values (e.g., blank ratings or occupancy %)
- Normalize naming conventions (e.g., platform names, property IDs)
- Convert numeric fields to consistent formats
- Derive calculated metrics: RevPAR , Occupancy %, Realisation %, Cancellation %

3. Data Modeling
- Design star schema with fact and dimension tables:
- Fact Table: Bookings, revenue, ratings, cancellations
- Dimension Tables: Properties, Cities, Platforms, Time
- Establish relationships between tables to enable filtering and slicing
  
4. Dashboard Design & Development
- Tool: Power BI
- Components built: KPI cards for revenue, ADR, RevPAR, occupancy, realization; Filters by city, room type, and time; Pie chart for category-wise occupancy; Bar/line charts for trend analysis; Detailed table for property-wise comparison; Platform performance with dual-axis visuals (ADR vs realization)
